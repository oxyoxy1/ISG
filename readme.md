# Interactive Story Generator (ISG)

Welcome to **Interactive Story Generator (ISG)**! This Python-based program allows users to generate custom adventure stories where they make key decisions that affect the outcome. The story progresses based on the user's choices, and they can even decide how long the adventure should be, from short to long.

## Features

- Customizable story length: short, medium, or long.
- Multiple choices at various stages of the story.
- The ability to create a unique, branching adventure with each playthrough.
- A system that lets you add additional chapters, generating a dynamic and interactive story experience.
- Randomized conclusions based on the choices you make.
